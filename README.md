\# Deep Learning-Based Time Series Analysis of ECG Signals



This repository presents a deep learning–based time series analysis framework for electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, designed to support reliable clinical decision-making. The project integrates statistical time series analysis with deep sequential models to capture complex temporal dynamics in biomedical signals.



\## Dataset

The experiments are conducted using the \*\*MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset\*\* obtained from the PhysioNet repository. This dataset consists of annotated ECG recordings containing both normal and abnormal cardiac rhythms.



\## Methodology

The proposed framework includes:

\- ECG signal preprocessing (noise filtering and normalization)

\- Time series analysis (stationarity and autocorrelation analysis)

\- Deep learning–based temporal modeling using LSTM networks with an attention mechanism

\- Performance evaluation using standard metrics
